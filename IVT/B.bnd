RecognizedString yes 0 2.2
RecognizedString the ideas sparkling new form 575.5 577.9
RecognizedString and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime 1126.9 1131.9
RecognizedString does it theory actually work when you tried apply to the real world war turns out that einstein includes and many others 512.4 520.3
RecognizedString a vibrating energy vibrating indifferent frequencies different frequencies produce the different particles 664 670.9
RecognizedString we don't yet see now 45.9 48.9
RecognizedString worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it too 520.3 525.9
RecognizedString the physics of the universe as was understood it the time 525.9 529.7
RecognizedString any detail didn't work and detail friends that couldn't get the mass of the electronic workout correctly and this theory so many people work donna popeye the 529.7 539.5
RecognizedString fourty certainly by the fifties this strange 539.5 543.1
RecognizedString but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away 543.1 549.1
RecognizedString until something wonderful happened in our h 549.1 552.6
RecognizedString in our area of a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicistt touching myself money i was around the world it's called super string theory as you are indicating 552.6 563.9
RecognizedString mazing possibility thank you very much 1131.9 1134.4
RecognizedString and the wonderful thing is that super string theory has nothing to do at first sight 563.9 569.5
RecognizedString with this idea of actor dimensions 569.5 572.1
RecognizedString let me just tell you how the super string theory what is it was a the're the tries to answer the question what are the basic fundamental 577.9 586
RecognizedString different particles are responsible 670.9 673.8
RecognizedString bob me study super string theory find reza rex 572.1 575.5
RecognizedString when someone makes a boldin bizarre idea sometime that old is ball design has nothing to do with the world around us this particular idea however 48.9 59.1
RecognizedString for all the rich this in the world around and they're you see unification 673.8 678.3
RecognizedString fairmont switching the next to use my telephone it right or wrong this ideas had a major impact on physics in the last century 62.8 70.7
RecognizedString because matter particles electrons in forks radiation particle photon gravity cats are all built up from one entity 678.3 687.5
RecognizedString some matter and the forces of nature o 687.5 690.6
RecognizedString 1134.4 1145.9
RecognizedString are put together under the rubric vibrating strings and that's what you mean by a unified theory a here is the catch 690.6 700
RecognizedString when you study the mathematics or string theory you find the doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensional space 700 707.1
RecognizedString it doesn't work any universe with for dimensional space nor five nor sex 707.1 711.8
RecognizedString finally you can study the equation show that it works only any universe that has ten dimensions of space 711.8 719.2
RecognizedString and one dimension of time 719.2 722.3
RecognizedString indivisible on horrible can stay shorts making up everything in the world around us 586 592.6
RecognizedString latest right back to this idea of gluten klein that are world when appropriately described has more dimensions 722.3 730.6
RecognizedString than the ones that we say 730.6 733.1
RecognizedString now you might think about that say well ok enough yeah baxter dimensions in really tidy curled up yet perhaps perhaps we won't see them if there's mona but 733.1 743.1
RecognizedString continue to inform a lot of cutting edge research i'd like to tell you something about the story this extra dimensions 70.7 77.9
RecognizedString you don't know whether it's right or wrong and i pnl discussion 59.1 62.8
RecognizedString you know if there's a little tiny civilization agree people walkman diner you make them small enough we want see them either 743.1 749
RecognizedString that is true one of the other predictions of string theory 749 753.7
RecognizedString no that's not one of the other predictions of string theory blood erase the question are we just trying to hideaway these actually dimensions 753.7 761.8
RecognizedString or do they tell or something about the world 761.8 764.8
RecognizedString and the remaining tom i'd like to tell you to features of them 764.8 768.5
RecognizedString first is many of a believe that 768.5 771.5
RecognizedString the idea is like this so imagine 592.6 595.8
RecognizedString does actor dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics 771.5 779.3
RecognizedString theoretical science in that question is this when we look around the world 779.3 783.3
RecognizedString as scientists of damn for last hundred years there appear to be about twenty numbers 783.3 787.9
RecognizedString a theory of gravity late sixteen hundred that works well describes the motion a planet 108 113.3
RecognizedString that really describe our universities are numbers like the mass of the particles like electrons in court 787.9 793.8
RecognizedString so are we go to begin need a backstory 77.9 81.2
RecognizedString strength of gravity this train to electromagnetic force alyssa about twenty numbers that happen measured 793.8 800.1
RecognizedString with incredible proceed and but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do now 800.1 809.5
RecognizedString does string theory often answer not yet 809.5 812.1
RecognizedString what we believe the answer for why those numbers have devise a jumeirah live 812.1 816.2
RecognizedString on the form of the actor dimensions in the wonderful thing is if pose numbers had any other by is than known once the universe as we know it wouldn't exist 816.2 826.4
RecognizedString we look at a familiar object just a candle holder 595.8 599.5
RecognizedString this is a deep question why this number so finally to stars to shinin planets form when we recognize 826.4 833.6
RecognizedString thank you fiddle with those numbers if i had twenty dials up you're in a let you come up infidel withers numbers 833.6 838.9
RecognizedString 2.2 9.2
RecognizedString almost any feeling makes 838.9 841.8
RecognizedString the universe disappear to can we explain does twenty numbers and string theory suggest twenty numbers have to do with the actor dimensions 841.8 850.8
RecognizedString let me show you how can we 850.8 853.4
RecognizedString go to nineteen oh seven this is a year when einstein is 81.2 85.5
RecognizedString talk about the actor dimensions in string theory 853.4 856.2
RecognizedString it's not one actually dimension as in the older ideas of closer and klein 856.2 861.7
RecognizedString this is what string theory says about the actor dimensions they have a very rich 861.7 866.6
RecognizedString internet wind geometry this is an example of something on a zack labia shape 866.6 872
RecognizedString imagine that we want to figure out what it is made out so we going to journey deep in 599.5 604.3
RecognizedString name is and all that important but as you can see the 872 876
RecognizedString 1145.9 1150.6
RecognizedString extra dimensions fold in on themselves in inter twine in a very interesting shape interesting structure any ideas that if this is what 876 885.1
RecognizedString the actually dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us 885.1 891.3
RecognizedString would look like this on the tiniest of scales when you swing your handy moving around is actor dimensions over and over again but they're so small that we wouldn't know it 891.3 899.9
RecognizedString so what is the physical implication no relevant plus twenty numbers consider this 899.9 904.2
RecognizedString you look at the instrument or french or notice a t vibrations of air streams are affected by the shape of the instrument 904.2 910.9
RecognizedString bath in glow of having discover the special theory of relativity indecisive take on a new 85.5 92
RecognizedString now in string theory all the numbers 910.9 913.5
RecognizedString i reflections of the way strings can vibrate to just does air streams are affected by the twist send turns instrument 913.5 921
RecognizedString strings themselves be affected by the vibration or patterns in geometry 921 925.5
RecognizedString why the object exam in the can teach us to deep inside the all know yos officially far down you have adams 604.3 611
RecognizedString 1150.6 1152.6
RecognizedString within which they are moving slow me bring some strings into the story and if you watch the little feliz vibrating around the be her in a second right there north away vibrate 925.5 935.3
RecognizedString is affected by the geometry the actor dimensions 935.3 938.1
RecognizedString so if we knew exactly what the actor demented looks like we don't yet but if we did we should be able to calculate the allowed notes 938.1 945.7
RecognizedString the allowed vibration or patterns and if we could catholic loud by bracelet patterns we should be able to calculate 945.7 952.7
RecognizedString does twenty numbers fb answer that we get from are calculations 952.7 957.8
RecognizedString agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determine through details in precise experiment tation 957.8 965.1
RecognizedString this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation 965.1 969.6
RecognizedString project to try to understand fully legrand purvis have force of gravity 92 99
RecognizedString for why the structure of the universe is the way it is now the second su that i want to finish up with is 969.6 977.9
RecognizedString how my we test for the next to dimensions more 977.9 982.3
RecognizedString the most and the moon and so force 113.3 115.6
RecognizedString we also all know the adams not the end of the story 611 613.7
RecognizedString directly is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some 982.3 989.5
RecognizedString previously unexplained features of the world 989.5 992.5
RecognizedString or kemy actually test for the jack dimensions in we think as i think very exciting that the next five years are so we may be able to test 992.5 1001.8
RecognizedString for the existence of these actor dimensions here's how it goes 1001.8 1006.3
RecognizedString in cern geneva switzerland machine is being built the large hadron collider 1006.3 1012.2
RecognizedString it's machine that will send particles 1012.2 1014.4
RecognizedString around tunnel opposite directions near the speed of light every so often does particles will be am that each other to lose ahead on collision 1014.4 1023
RecognizedString the hope is that if the collision as enough energy it may a jacked 1023 1028.8
RecognizedString and in the moment there are many people around who father dad 99 104.1
RecognizedString the motion of a powerful apple fine from trees any people head all of that could be describe using newton's work but 115.6 123.5
RecognizedString some of the debrief from the collision from our dimensions 1028.8 1032.8
RecognizedString they have little electrons it's warm miranda central nucleus with neutron protons 613.7 619
RecognizedString forcing it to enter into the other dimensions 1032.8 1035.8
RecognizedString how we know it what will measure the amount of energy after the collision compare at three math energy before 1035.8 1042.5
RecognizedString actors less energy after the collision number four 1042.5 1046.3
RecognizedString just be evidence at the energy has drift away and for drift away the right pattern that we can calculate disobey evidence 1046.3 1052.5
RecognizedString at the actor dimensions are there let me show the idea visually 1052.5 1056.2
RecognizedString so magine we have a certain kinda particle taller gravitation that's kind of debris we expect to be a jacket out if the dimensions a real here's had experiment will go 1056.2 1067.3
RecognizedString you take particles you slam together you slam it together 1067.3 1070.9
RecognizedString nf we are write some of the energy that collision will going to debris that flies off 1070.9 1076.4
RecognizedString even the neutrons and protons it's more particles inside of them known as quarts that is work conventional idea stop 619 626.9
RecognizedString einstein realise new net left something out of the story because even newton had written that'll though he understood how 123.5 131.9
RecognizedString into these actually dimensions so this is a kind of experiment that will be looking at the next five 1076.4 1081.8
RecognizedString project already been resolve newton given the world 104.1 108
RecognizedString to calculate effective gravity havent unable to figure out 131.9 135.8
RecognizedString how it really works how is the sun ninety three million miles away somehow defects the motion 135.8 142.4
RecognizedString of the earth how does the sun reach out across empty a nerd space and exert 142.4 147.8
RecognizedString here's the new idea string theory 626.9 629
RecognizedString influence and that is a task to which einstein set himself to figure out 147.8 152.3
RecognizedString how gravity works and let me show you what it is found so einstein found that medium that transmit 152.3 159.9
RecognizedString gravity is space itself 159.9 162
RecognizedString the idea goes like this imagine space is a substrate of all the resign sunsets basic nice and flat 162 168.2
RecognizedString emir nineteen nineteen 9.2 15.7
RecognizedString seven two ten years yourself and if this experiment bears fruit if we see that kind of particle jacket 1081.8 1089.6
RecognizedString if there's no matter present but if there is matter in environment such as the sonic causes the fabric of space to worp check curve and bakshi mina cates 168.2 178.7
RecognizedString the force of gravity even the earth 178.7 181.5
RecognizedString worp space around it now look at the moon 181.5 184.2
RecognizedString the moon is captain orbit according to is ideas because it rolls along valley in the curved environment that v e 184.2 191.6
RecognizedString sun and the moon and earth can all create by virtue of the presents 191.6 195.9
RecognizedString deep inside any of these particles there is something else 629 633.5
RecognizedString go to a full frame view of this the earth itself is captain or because it rosa long valley 195.9 202.4
RecognizedString in the environment that curved because of the sons presents that is this new idea about how 202.4 209.4
RecognizedString gravity actually works now 209.4 213.3
RecognizedString this id was tested nineteen nineteen through astronomical observations it really works describes data 213.3 219.8
RecognizedString by noticing apples less energy in our dimensions then when we begin this will show the dimensions are real 1089.6 1097.7
RecognizedString and this gained einstein prominent around the world and that is what got 219.8 225.8
RecognizedString a virtually unknown german mathematician name theater closer 15.7 22.5
RecognizedString call it's a thinking he like einstein wasn't search of what we call a unified theory 225.8 232.2
RecognizedString that's one fury that might be able to scribe 232.2 235.1
RecognizedString all of nature's forces from one stead of ideas one setup principles one master equation if you will supposed to certain self 235.1 244.1
RecognizedString einstein has been able to describe gravity 244.1 246.6
RecognizedString something else is dancing filament of energy it looks like a vibrating string 633.5 638.4
RecognizedString in terms of worp sing curves in space in fact space and time to more precise maybe i can play the same game 246.6 254.8
RecognizedString where the other known force which was the time 254.8 258.5
RecognizedString known as the electromagnetic force me of other today but that time that was jani other one people are thinking about your the forces park for electricity magnetic attraction in cell fourth 258.5 267.9
RecognizedString enemy this is a really remarkable store in a remarkable opportunity going back to newton 1097.7 1102.9
RecognizedString circle to says maybe i can play this game describe electromagnetic force in terms of works in kurtz 267.9 274.6
RecognizedString that raise the question watching curves in what 274.6 278.6
RecognizedString einstein at already used up space and time 278.6 282.7
RecognizedString suggested a very bold and the 22.5 26
RecognizedString watching curves to describe gravity didn't seem to be anything else war curve suck lupita said well 282.7 290.3
RecognizedString maybe there are more dimensions of spacey said ever won describe one more force maybe i need one more 290.3 296.7
RecognizedString dimensions zoe imagine a world at four dimensional space not three 296.7 301.1
RecognizedString that's where the idea string theory comes from and just like the vibrating strings that you just sona chela can vibrate indifferent patterns these can also vibrating different patterns 638.4 647.7
RecognizedString and maginet electromagnet is watson curves in that fourth dimension 301.1 305.9
RecognizedString nah here's the thing when he wrote down the equations describing wharton craven universal force 305.9 310.6
RecognizedString absolute space didn't provide anything button arena est in which the events the universe take place 1102.9 1108.9
RecognizedString based mansions not three p found the old equations that einstein had already driving three dimensions browser for gravity 310.6 317.8
RecognizedString what are you found one more equation because of the one more dimension 317.8 321.8
RecognizedString how many look that equation it was not other than the equation at scientists head long known to describe electromagnetic force 321.8 328.9
RecognizedString amazing i just popped up 328.9 331.2
RecognizedString he was so excited by this realization that you ran around is house screaming victory that he had found the unified theory 331.2 340.1
RecognizedString in someone's very bizarre idea he propose that our universe mine actually have more than three dimensions 26 34.3
RecognizedString now clearly cool it was a man who talk 340.1 344.1
RecognizedString theory very seriously in fact there's a story that when he want to learn how to swim 344.1 351
RecognizedString they don't produce different musical notes rather they produce the different particles making up the world around us 647.7 653.3
RecognizedString he read a book a treat is on swimming 351 354.9
RecognizedString einstein comes along is as well space and time can war pink curve that's what gravity is and now 1108.9 1114.9
RecognizedString bend over and to the ocean with a man what rest kid life on theory 354.9 360.4
RecognizedString now buffalos about your little boy practically minded to questions amelia rise from his observation number one if there are more dimensional space where are they 360.4 370.8
RecognizedString you don't seem to see them and number two 370.8 373.7
RecognizedString does this theory really work in detail when you try to apply it to the world around us 373.7 379.7
RecognizedString now the first question was answered in nineteen twenty six 379.7 384.1
RecognizedString by felony master fine he's suggested that dimensions mike come into varieties 384.1 390
RecognizedString the might be big easy dimensions but the miles be tiny curled up dimensions product so small even other all around us 390 398.3
RecognizedString that we are all aware that isn't addition to left right back fourth and up down 34.3 40.2
RecognizedString that we don't see them let me show you that one visually 398.3 402.2
RecognizedString that these ideas are correct this is what the ultra microscopic landscape 653.3 657.6
RecognizedString string theory comes along and says yes 1114.9 1117.7
RecognizedString so imagi looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light sim manhattan new central park and cobb relevant but the cable lots one dimensional 402.2 412.3
RecognizedString from a distance view point but you know another does hasn't thickness it's very hard to see a from far away barbie zoom in 412.3 419.7
RecognizedString and take a perspective it's a little am walking around 419.7 422.8
RecognizedString little answer so small that they can access all dimensions the long dimension profit clockwise 422.8 428.6
RecognizedString counterclockwise direction and i hope you preciate does it take 428.6 432.1
RecognizedString so long to get a chance to do this potato illustrator faggot dimensions cambia tu sorts big and small 432.1 439.9
RecognizedString any ideas maybe the big dimensions around us other ones that we can easily see butter my additional dimensions curled up sort of like the circular part of the table 439.9 449.9
RecognizedString so small that they have so far remained invisible let me show me what that would look like 449.9 455.8
RecognizedString self we take a look say at space itself 455.8 460
RecognizedString close it propose at my additional dimensions of space that for some reason 40.2 45.9
RecognizedString gravity quantum mechanics electra magnum altogether one package but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see 1117.7 1126.9
RecognizedString of the universe looks like it's built up a huge number of the little tiny filament 657.6 664
RecognizedString i can only show chris to dimensions on screen some you gotta fix at one day but anything that not flat screen as a new dimension go smaller 460 467.7
RecognizedString smaller smaller and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself this is the idea 467.7 473.9
RecognizedString you could have additional curled up dimensions here's a little shape of a circle so small that we don't see them 473.9 479
RecognizedString but if you were a little ultra microscopic aunt walking randy can walk in the big dimensions that we all know about that's like the grid part 479 485.9
RecognizedString but you can also access the tiny curled up dimension 485.9 489.5
RecognizedString that's so small that we can't see with a naked iyer even with any ramos refind equipment but deeply talked 489.5 495.8
RecognizedString into the fabric of space itself the ideas could be more dimensions as we see there now 495.8 503.4
RecognizedString that's 503.4 505.5
RecognizedString an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see what about the second question that i asked 505.5 512.4
