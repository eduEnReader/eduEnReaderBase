RecognizedString yes 0 2.2
RecognizedString this is from news week magazine hardly and esoteric publication today's engineers acknowledge that building new roads 566.5 573.3
RecognizedString usually makes traffic worse and my response to reading this was 573.3 577.1
RecognizedString may i please meet somebody's engineers because these are not the ones that i typically there are great exceptions that i'm working with now 577.1 582.8
RecognizedString what is not the engineers that one typically meets working in city where they say oh that road is 582.8 588.4
RecognizedString too crowded we need to add elaine's you add elaine and the traffic cams and they say see i told you in into that lane 588.4 594.8
RecognizedString so the supplies both to highways and to city streeter there congested but the amazing thing about most american cities that i work in the more typical cities is they have a lot of streets that are actually 594.8 605.2
RecognizedString oversized for the congestion there currently experiencing this was the case in oklahoma city 605.2 610.1
RecognizedString when the mayer came running to me a very upset because they were named in prevention magazine 610.1 615.4
RecognizedString the worst city for pedestrian in the entire country that can possibly be true 615.4 620.3
RecognizedString but it certainly is enough to make a mayer a do something about it and we did a walk ability study and what we found looking at the car counts on the street deezer 620.3 628.8
RecognizedString a little tongue and cheek but it's something i thought about for a long time 59.3 63.2
RecognizedString three thousand four thousand seven thousand car counting we know that to lanes can handle ten thousand cars per day 628.8 635.9
RecognizedString so look at these numbers right there all near or under ten thousand 635.9 639.8
RecognizedString cars and these with a these with the street that were designated in the new 639.8 644.1
RecognizedString downtown plan to be for lanes two six lanes wide sierra fundamental disconnect 644.1 649.9
RecognizedString tween the number of lanes and the number of cars that wanted to use them 649.9 653.3
RecognizedString so it was my shahab to redesign 653.3 656
RecognizedString every street in the downtown from curb face to curb face and we did it for fifty blocks streets and we're rebuilding at now so typical unit oversized street ten 656 664.7
RecognizedString to know where is being narrow the now under construction the project a half done the tidwell street like this note 664.7 671.6
RecognizedString when you do that you find room 671.6 674.4
RecognizedString for mediums you find room for bike lanes we've double d madam on street parking 674.4 679.2
RecognizedString and i'm i like to share what i think i figured out 63.2 66.5
RecognizedString we've added awful bike network were one it didn't exist for 679.2 682.8
RecognizedString but not everyone has the money that oklahoma city has 682.8 686.4
RecognizedString tuesday about extraction economy this doing quite well the typical city is malek cedar rapids were also they of all for lane system 686.4 694.1
RecognizedString half one way system and it's a little hard to see but what we've done 694.1 698.3
RecognizedString what we're doing it's in process right now it's in engineering right now is turning a off orleans system 698.3 704.9
RecognizedString half one way into a all to lane system 704.9 708.4
RecognizedString oh to way and in so doing were attic seventy percent moron street park in which the merchants love and it protect the sidewalk that parking mix the sidewalk safe 708.4 717.5
RecognizedString and we're adding a much more robust bicycle network 717.5 720.9
RecognizedString then the the lanes themselves how wider they that's really important the standards of change such that as undress twenty says the table road to subdivision in america allows you to see the curve picture of the earth 720.9 731.8
RecognizedString this is a subdivision 731.8 734.7
RecognizedString in the american city the typical american city natural american city is not washington d c or new york or san francisco it's grand rapids or cedar rapids or memphis 66.5 77.3
RecognizedString outside of washing to from the nineteen sixty is look very carefully at the with the streets this is a subdivision from the nineteen eighty's 734.7 741.3
RecognizedString nineteen sixty is nineteen eighty the status of change to such a degree that mild neighbour south beach 741.3 746.6
RecognizedString when was time to fix the street that wasn't draining properly they had to widen and takeaway half are sidewalk because the standards were wider 746.6 754.3
RecognizedString i people go faster on wider streets 754.3 757.8
RecognizedString people know this the engineers deny it 757.8 760.5
RecognizedString but the citizens know it so that in 760.5 763.1
RecognizedString birmingham michigan they fight for for an hour streets of portland oregon famous lee walkable institute it's skinny streets program in it's residential neighborhood we know that skinny streets are safer 763.1 773.8
RecognizedString the developer vince graham a in his 773.8 776.3
RecognizedString project ion which we worked on in south carolina he goes to conferences ne shows is amazing twenty two four 776.3 782.6
RecognizedString roads are to a roads very now right away and he shows this well known philosopher who said 782.6 788.2
RecognizedString what in the typical american city in which most people on cars and the temptations dr them all the time 77.3 82.8
RecognizedString broad is the road that leads to destruction narrow is the road that lisa live in this this 788.2 797.3
RecognizedString plays very well in south now bicycles 797.3 801.6
RecognizedString bicycles and bicycling are the current 801.6 804.5
RecognizedString revolution underway in only some american cities but where you build a they com anissa planner i'd hate to say that 804.5 812.1
RecognizedString what the one thing i can say is that bicycle population is a function of bicycle infrastructure 812.1 817.7
RecognizedString i asked my friend tom brennan from nelson i guard in portland to send me some pictures of the portland bike mutiny sent me this and i said was that 817.7 825.3
RecognizedString like to work day any said no that was tuesday when you do what portland did and you spend money on bicycle infrastructure 825.3 832.9
RecognizedString i'm near city is double d number bikers in it several times now 832.9 837.3
RecognizedString by painting these bright green lanes even automotive cities like long beach california vast optic 837.3 844.4
RecognizedString in the number of bakers based on a infrastructure and of course what really does it 844.4 848.7
RecognizedString if you're gonna get them to walk the new half the offer 82.8 85.7
RecognizedString if you know fifteenth street here in washington d c please meet romney manuals new bike lanes in chicago the buffer lane parallel parking pulled off the curb 848.7 857.6
RecognizedString the bikes between the cars and the park cars and curb this meant cyclist 857.6 863.4
RecognizedString if however as in pasadena every lane as a bike lane then no lane is a bike lane 863.4 869.1
RecognizedString and this is the only bicycles that i met in pasadena sa 869.1 873.6
RecognizedString parallel parking i mention it essential barrier steel that to text the curb i'm restaurants for moving vehicles um 873.6 881.7
RecognizedString this is fort lauderdale one sided history you can park the other street south st you can't 881.7 886.7
RecognizedString this is happy hour on the parking side this is 886.7 889.5
RecognizedString sad our honey heather side and understood trees themselves trees slow cars down they move slower when trees are next to the road and of course sometimes they slow down very quickly 889.5 899.8
RecognizedString all the little details the curb return radius at one fourty or is it fourty feet house whoopee 899.8 905.6
RecognizedString is that curb to determine how fast car goes and how much room you have to cross and then i love this because 905.6 911.6
RecognizedString a walk that as good as a dr were better what does that mean it means that you need to offer for thing simultaneously needs to be a proper reason to locked 85.7 94.2
RecognizedString this is objective journalism some say the entrance to city center is not inviting to restaurants 911.6 917.1
RecognizedString when every aspect of the landscape is poopy is error dynamic is stream form geometric that says 917.1 923.1
RecognizedString this is a vehicle replace so no one detail no one specialty can be allowed 923.1 928.6
RecognizedString set the stage and here you know the street yes it will drain within a minute of the hundred year storm 928.6 935.5
RecognizedString but does for woman asked him out the curb everyday 935.5 938.1
RecognizedString so then copy the comfortable walk has to do with the fact that all animals seek simultaneously prospect 938.1 945.1
RecognizedString and refuge we want to be able to see are preditors 945.1 948.5
RecognizedString what we also wanna feel that are flags are covered and sore drawn to places that have good edges and if you don't supply the edges people want 948.5 955.7
RecognizedString want to be there what's the proper ratio of height to it this at one two one three two one if you get beyond one to six you're not very comfortable 955.7 964.1
RecognizedString anymore you don't feel enclosed now sixty one in salt bored can be perfectly delightful the opposite of salzburg is houston 964.1 971.3
RecognizedString the walk has to be safe and feel safe to walk has to be comfortable 94.2 98.2
RecognizedString write the point being the parking lot as the principal up problem here a however missing teeth 971.3 977.6
RecognizedString does empty lots computers as well and view of missing corner because been outdated zoning code then you could ever missing 977.6 983.9
RecognizedString nose in your neighbourhood that's we had in my neighborhood others this owning code that said i couldn't build 983.9 989.6
RecognizedString on that site as you know dc is now or humane at washing dishes now changing it sony 989.6 994.5
RecognizedString to allow sites like this to become sites like this we renew lotta variance is to do that 994.5 999.8
RecognizedString triangular houses can be interesting to build but if you get one built people 999.8 1003.8
RecognizedString generally like it so gotta phil those missing noses and then finally the interesting walk signs of humanity 1003.8 1010.9
RecognizedString you know we're among the social prime it's nothing interested more than other people are we want signs of people so the perfect 1010.9 1017.2
RecognizedString one two one ratio it's a great thing this is grand rapids very walkable city but nobody walks on this street 1017.2 1023.5
RecognizedString that connects to best hotels together because on the left your ivana left you have a expose parking back in on the right you have a 1023.5 1031.5
RecognizedString and the walk has to be interesting you need to do off for a decent simultaneously and knows the structure of my talk today's to take you through each of those 98.2 106.2
RecognizedString carmen's facility that was apparently 1031.5 1033.6
RecognizedString designed in admiration for that parking dec ten you don't attract at many paper 1033.6 1038.4
RecognizedString a marriage o'reilly and is tenth term mayor of charleston south carolina tatas analytics twenty five feet of building 1038.4 1044.8
RecognizedString to hide two hundred and fifty feet of garage this when i called chia pet garages in south beach that active ground floor and then this is are gonna end with this project that i love to show it 1044.8 1053.9
RecognizedString by malacca architects in columbus ohio to the left 1053.9 1057.7
RecognizedString is that convention center neighborhood full of pedestrian to the right is that short north neighbourhood f nick 1057.7 1063
RecognizedString what restaurants great shops struggling and it wasn't doing very well because this was the bridge and no one was walking from the convention center into that neighbourhood well 1063 1072.9
RecognizedString when they rebuilt the highway the added an extra eighty feet to the bridge that i they rebuilt the bridge over the highway 1072.9 1078.9
RecognizedString the city paid one point nine million dollars 1078.9 1081.3
