Then one day you wake up, 1:22 and they tell you &quot;you're a queen,&quot; 1:26 but then you find that someone else is pulling on the strings. 1:32 Rollercoaster, carousel. 1:42 Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. 1:48 You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, 1:55 when the ride is over, you can never tell. 2:05 The one you love, they love you — oh yeah — until the end of time. 2:13 But lose your edge or lose your cool, they will drop you like a dime. 2:20 Everyone is crowding 'round when fortune is your friend. 2:28 When your luck is running out, you're all alone again. 2:34 Rollercoaster, carousel. 2:43 Where the highs are heaven but the lows, oh, they can be hell. 2:50 You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, when the ride is over you can never tell. 3:07 Well, maybe I'm just cynical, and all these words are lies, 3:15 but experience keeps telling me that the cautious one is wise. 3:22 But caution makes you hesitate, and hesitate you're lost, 3:30 so take your opportunities and never count the cost. 3:36 Rollercoaster, carousel. Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, </span>oh, they can be hell. 3:52 You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, 3:59 when the ride is over — over, over, you can never, ever tell. 4:07 Rollercoaster, carousel, rollercoaster, yeah, yeah, yeah, carousel. Carousel, carousel, carousel, carousel. 4:44 (Applause) 4:47 Michael Pemberton. 4:49 (Applause) 4:52 Thank you so much. 4:54 Thank you. </p></body></html>
