RecognizedString listen to olive doesn't thinking about it i began to realize that we performed 579.7 585.9
RecognizedString 585.9 589.9
RecognizedString starting an infant see parents of baby boys are more likely to name other body parts let me sophie here's your pp 589.9 597.9
RecognizedString parents of baby girls go right from navel to knees and they leave this whole situation in here on named 597.9 605.7
RecognizedString there's no better way to make something on speakable the not to name it 605.7 611.5
RecognizedString then kids going to there puberty education classes and they learn that boys have erections and a jaculation 611.5 617.7
RecognizedString and girls have 617.7 620.1
RecognizedString periods and unwanted pregnancy and they see that 620.1 625.2

RecognizedString and young women climax at the same rate s man 677.9 681.6
RecognizedString lesbian and bisexual girls but tell me that they felt liberated to get off the script frida create an encounter 681.6 689.5
RecognizedString that worked for them gay grove also challenged 689.5 693
RecognizedString the idea of first intercourse is the definition of virginity 693 696.8
RecognizedString not because intercourse isn't a big deal 696.8 699.1
RecognizedString but it's worth questioning why we consider this one act 699.1 704
RecognizedString which most girls associate with discomfort or pain to be the line in the sand of sexual adult hood 704 710
RecognizedString so much more meaningful so much more transformer to than anything else 710 714.9
RecognizedString and it's worth considering how this is serving girls weather it's keeping them safer from disease coalition betrayal assault 714.9 725.2

RecognizedString that include form 791 793.2

RecognizedString are the one who get wasted at a party and hooks up with a random in order to dump there virginity before they get to college 812.8 821.2

RecognizedString and when we ignore that when we label that is not sex that open the door to risky behavior and disrespect 151.4 160.5
RecognizedString that's particularly true of oral sex which teenagers consider to be less intimate than intercourse 160.5 167
